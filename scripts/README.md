# Scripts directory

The are common scripts I re-use across projects.  These work on `GNU bash, version 5.0.16(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)`

| File | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| env.sh | Some stuff about the environment |
| go.sh | Some common scripts related to GO, formatting & vetting |
